spritesheet dimension: 896x256 px

card arrangement:
+ 14 x 4
+ joker and blank at the end
+ suit sorted spade, heart, club, diamond

margin to edge card = 12x2 px
margin between cards = 24x4px

empty space on x = (12 * 2) + (24 * 13) = 24 + 312 = 336
empty space on y = (2 * 2) + (4 * 3) = 4 + 12 = 16

card width = (896 - 336) / 14 = 40
card height = (256 - 16) / 4 = 60

sprite splitting dimension: (896 / 14) x (256 / 4) = 64x64
